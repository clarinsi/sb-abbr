NLP dataset of the Slovenian Biography

This repository contains samples from Slovenian biographies, in particular:
* Slovenian Biographical Lexicon (1925â€“1991)
* New Slovenian Biographical Lexicon (2013)
* The Primorska Biographical Lexicon (TBA)

The samples are meant to have manually verified annotations for:
* tokenisation
* sentence segmentation
* lemmatisation
* named entities
* abbreviation expansion

The canonical version of the samples is TEI, but serveral derived formats are also available.
